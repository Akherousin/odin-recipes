    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. I sprinkle with
      colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        <p>
          Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large
          bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.
          Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually
          blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and
          chill for 2 hours.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
          On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough
          to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely
        brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
      </li>
    </ol>

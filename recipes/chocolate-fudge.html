    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This was my aunt's recipe for fudge, passed down through the family. It's
      better than any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore, and easy enough
      to whip up in 15 minutes or so.
    </p>

      <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>

        Remove from heat and pour in semisweet chocolate chips and milk
        chocolate chips. Stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.
        Stir in nuts and vanilla. Pour into prepared pan. Chill in refrigerator
        for 2 hours, or until firm.
